    MORE TO COME IN FUTURE UPDATES!

Has a very simple UI.

Most features and stat scaling values are fully configurable in the mod config.
You can make Stataria as balanced or as broken as you want!

Multiplayer is not fully tested (sometimes there are syncing problems, sometimes rejoining the server fixes them), so if you run into issues, please report them. Thorium team effects boosted from mod does not work on others in multiplayer!

Don't forget to bind a key to open the Stat Panel under Controls > Keybindings.

Default values/settings for the mod can be considered unbalanced. I encourage changing/playing with the settings/values to fit your style of gameplay balance. I've tried making many things from the mod configurable.

May be compatible with other mods.
Inspired by the NExperience mod.
