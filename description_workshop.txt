Simple stat panel UI
  
[b] Most things are configurable in the mods config so go crazy. You can make this as balanced as you want! [/b]

[b] Multiplayer is not fully tested (sometimes there are syncing problems, sometimes rejoining server fixes them), so if anything happens or problems arrise, please let me know! Thorium team effects boosted from mod does not work on others in multiplayer![/b]

[b] Donâ€™t forget to bind a key to open the Stat Panel under Controls > Keybindings.[/b]

[b][u] Default values/settings for the mod can be considered unbalanced. I encourage changing/playing with the settings/values to fit your style of gameplay balance. I've tried making many things from the mod configurable. [/u][/b]

[i]Might be compatible with other mods... I don't fully know but try it out![/i]
